        <h2>What is Digital Marketing?</h2>
        <p>
          Digital marketing is the use of online tools, platforms, and strategies to promote products or services.
          From search engines and social media to email and video, digital marketing lets brands meet customers where they already spend a lot of time — online.
          Unlike traditional marketing, digital channels are measurable, targetable, and flexible.

        <h2>Main Types of Digital Marketing</h2>
        <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
        <p>
          SEO is about making your website easier for search engines to find and understand.
          Good SEO increases organic traffic by focusing on relevant keywords, useful content, and a fast, mobile-friendly site.
        </p>
        <h3>Content Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          Content marketing means creating valuable articles, videos, and resources that help your audience.
          When people find your content helpful, trust grows—and so do conversions over time.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          Social media helps you build brand recognition and engage directly with your audience.
          Different platforms suit different goals: Instagram for visuals, LinkedIn for B2B, TikTok for short viral content.
        </p>
        <h3>Email Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          Email remains one of the most powerful ways to build relationships. With segmentation and personalization, emails can turn prospects into repeat customers.
        </p>

        <h3>Paid Advertising (PPC)</h3>
        <p>
          Pay-per-click campaigns (on Google, Facebook, etc.) deliver immediate visibility. PPC is great for product launches and promotions when you need fast traffic.
        </p>
        <h3>Influencer & Affiliate Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          Collaborating with creators and partners helps you reach trusted audiences and grow brand credibility.
